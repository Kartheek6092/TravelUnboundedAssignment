                <p><strong>Day 1 - Nov 14th 2023 </strong>- Our drivers would pick up from the JKIA airport at 7AM. You would board
                our 4*4 Landcruisers to embark on your journey to Maasai Mara. The road journey takes about 5
                to 6 hours, but you would be amazed by the landscape enroute. You would first see the Nairobi
                national park on your left side. On a lucky day, you would also see a White Rhino grazing near the
                fence. Nairobi city has a national park right in its heart!! And it is home for Lions, Leopards, White
                rhinos, gazzelles, Giraffes, crowned cranes, and other mammals and birds. This is the only city in
                the World which boasts a National park within the city limits.</p>

                <p>After one hour you would climb up to The Great Rift Valley. This is one priced attraction of Kenya.
                    Formed a millions years back, this valley boasts beautiful lakes and escarpments, which provide
                    havens for plentiful wildlife. The Great Rift Valley runs for 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers), from
                    Jordan in southwestern Asia to the coast of the Indian Ocean in central Mozambique. We suggest
                    you request your driver to stop when you are on top and enjoy the views of this Natureâ€™s marvel.
                    You would reach Maasai Mara by noon. Complete your check in formalities and proceed to lunch.
                    After lunch, you would go on your first game drive on the great plains of Maasai Mara</p>

                at Mara. The Sunrise you witness at Mara is something which you would never get to witness

                <p>Our guides would park the vehicle under a tree for you to have a bush breakfast. This is an out of
                the World experience. At a distance you can see the animals peacefully grazing while you are
                enjoying your food. Post your breakfast, proceed again on the game drive. Mid mornings while the
                Lions sleep is a good time to look around for the cheetahs. November is also the season when the
                Topis give birth to young ones. On a lucky day, you might witness a Topi giving birth to a little one.
                Keep a watch on the hyenas as they would always be around a pregnant Topi!</p>

                <p><strong>Day 3 - Nov 16th </strong>- Today is a very busy day for you at Mara. Wake up early, freshen yourself,
                    have a hot beverage and jump into your designated vehicles. Today you would be going towards
                    the border of Maasai Mara. You would be going for a full day game drive with packed breakfast
                    and lunch.
                    Sand river is the border for Maasai Mara and Tanzania. This has been the entry point of the
                    migratory animals for millions of years. You would be amazed to see such a small river separates
                    two different countries!! Enjoy every bit your time as this is your last day of game drive for this trip.
                    Have lunch and take a small nap like our Maasai guides. Then proceed towards your camp. On the
                    way back encounter a pride of lion. During your stay at Mara, you would have seen the Big 4 our of
                    the Big 5. The Rhino being very elusive is going to be a difficult find. But this area is know for the
                    Rhinos. If you are lucky you would get to see one.
                    Return to the camp with great memories. Spend you evening at the camp fire before having dinner.
                    Retire for the day.
                    Sadly the holiday has come to an end. But at the end you would release that it was the journey
                    which was so beautiful. Have a blissful night.</p>
